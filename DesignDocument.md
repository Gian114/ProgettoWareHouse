# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements, and be consistent with the APIs

# High level design 

<discuss architectural styles used, if any>
<report package diagram, if needed>






# Low level design

![Low level design](Resources/LowLevelDesign.jpg "Low level design")









# Verification traceability matrix

\<for each functional requirement from the requirement document, list which classes concur to implement it>
| ID  | Class1 | Class2 | Class3 |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| FR1 | | | |
| FR2 | | | |
| FR3 | | | |
| FR4 | | | |
| FR5 | | | |

# Verification sequence diagrams 
\<select key scenarios from the requirement document. For each of them define a sequence diagram showing that the scenario can be implemented by the classes and methods in the design>
